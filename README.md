# Multi-Signature Wallet

## Overview

A secure and decentralized wallet that requires multiple owners to approve transactions before execution. This contract enhances fund security by preventing unauthorized transactions and is ideal for DAOs, joint business accounts, and shared financial management.

## Features

- **Multiple Owners**: Supports multiple authorized wallet owners.
- **Approval Mechanism**: Transactions require a minimum number of approvals before execution.
- **Secure Fund Storage**: Holds Ether securely until transactions are approved and executed.
- **Decentralized Control**: No single owner can unilaterally withdraw funds.
- **Event Logging**: Records transaction proposals, approvals, and executions for transparency.

## Usage

1. **Deploy the Contract**: Provide an array of owner addresses and specify the required number of approvals.
2. **Fund the Wallet**: Send Ether to the contract to store funds securely.
3. **Submit a Transaction**: An owner can propose a transaction specifying the recipient and amount.
4. **Approve Transactions**: Other owners review and approve pending transactions.
5. **Execute Transactions**: Once the required number of approvals is met, the transaction can be executed.

## Key Functions

- `constructor(address[] memory _owners, uint _requiredApprovals)`: Initializes the contract with owners and required approvals.
- `submitTransaction(address _to, uint _value)`: Proposes a transaction for approval.
- `approveTransaction(uint _txIndex)`: Approves a pending transaction.
- `executeTransaction(uint _txIndex)`: Executes a transaction if it has enough approvals.
- `receive() external payable {}`: Allows the contract to receive Ether.

## Security Considerations

- **Owner Trust**: Ensure that only trusted individuals are added as owners.
- **Approval Threshold**: Set an appropriate number of required approvals to balance security and flexibility.
- **No Single Point of Failure**: Transactions cannot be executed without collective approval.
- **Event Logs**: All actions are recorded on-chain for transparency.

## Example Use Cases

- **DAO Treasury Management**: Ensures collective control over decentralized organization funds.
- **Joint Business Accounts**: Prevents unauthorized fund withdrawals.
- **Family or Group Savings**: Ensures mutual agreement before spending funds.
