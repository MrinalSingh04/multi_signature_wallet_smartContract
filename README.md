# 🔐 Multi-Signature Wallet

## 📌 Overview
A **secure and decentralized** wallet that requires multiple owners to approve transactions before execution. This contract enhances fund security by preventing unauthorized transactions and is ideal for **DAOs, joint business accounts, and shared financial management**.

## ✨ Features
- ✅ **Multiple Owners**: Supports multiple authorized wallet owners.
- 🔑 **Approval Mechanism**: Transactions require a minimum number of approvals before execution.
- 💰 **Secure Fund Storage**: Holds Ether securely until transactions are approved and executed.
- ⚖️ **Decentralized Control**: No single owner can unilaterally withdraw funds.
- 📜 **Event Logging**: Records transaction proposals, approvals, and executions for transparency.

## 🚀 Usage
1️⃣ **Deploy the Contract**: Provide an array of owner addresses and specify the required number of approvals.  
2️⃣ **Fund the Wallet**: Send Ether to the contract to store funds securely.  
3️⃣ **Submit a Transaction**: An owner can propose a transaction specifying the recipient and amount.  
4️⃣ **Approve Transactions**: Other owners review and approve pending transactions.  
5️⃣ **Execute Transactions**: Once the required number of approvals is met, the transaction can be executed.  

## 🔍 Key Functions
- 🏗️ `constructor(address[] memory _owners, uint _requiredApprovals)`: Initializes the contract with owners and required approvals.
- ✍️ `submitTransaction(address _to, uint _value)`: Proposes a transaction for approval.
- 👍 `approveTransaction(uint _txIndex)`: Approves a pending transaction.
- 🚀 `executeTransaction(uint _txIndex)`: Executes a transaction if it has enough approvals.

## ⚠️ Security Considerations
- 🔐 **Owner Trust**: Ensure that only trusted individuals are added as owners.
- ⚖️ **Approval Threshold**: Set an appropriate number of required approvals to balance security and flexibility.
- 🛡️ **No Single Point of Failure**: Transactions cannot be executed without collective approval.
